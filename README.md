# amedpal website

This is the latest (and hopefully final) version of my production website, built with NextJS, Typescript, and SCSS. Hosted on Netlify.

## Gettings started

Install dependencies by running `npm install` and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Before sending it to production make sure it does not have any warnings or errors because the `build` command will fail if it encounters any, thus resulting in a failed deployment. To check for warnings and errors run:

```bash
npm run  lint
```

## TODO

- Finish basic website with standard pages
  - ~~Home page~~
  - ~~Contact page~~
  - ~~Services page~~
- Implement a blog using MongoDB
- Dockerize application
