# amedpal website

This is the latest (and hopefully final) version of my production website, built with NextJS, Typescript, and SCSS.

## Gettings started

Install dependencies by running `npm install` and run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## TODO

- Finish basic website with standard pages
  - Home page
  - Contact page
  - Services page
- Implement a blog using MongoDB
- Dockerize application
